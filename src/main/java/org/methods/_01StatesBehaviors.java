-                               All programs have two basic attributes:

`                                   1. Program State  (variables)

`                                   2. Program Behavior (methods)


-                                   A program's state is it's current condition.

-                                   A program's behavior is what changes the program state
-                                   or current condition.

!                                  This lesson module will focus on program behaviours known otherwise
!                                  as methods.
